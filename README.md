# CommonSents
This chrome plugin allows you to highlight sentences and annotate interior keywords as Pos/Neg/Neu with hotkeys and a right-click dropdown menu. It functions over all websites. The annotations are stored in localstorage. The user then copy/pastes the formatted contents into an email and sends it to my automated account. TODO is to get the app to auto email the storage. 

Example of annotation with dropdown menu:

Visual queues on what you've annotated appear as so:

**Introduction:**

<div style="padding: 20px;">

Welcome! This is a tool primarily to help Julian collect a dataset. The first slides introduce what he's doing and why this is a great project.

It should also be helpful to you as an educational tool. At your discretion, you will begin to slow down and process what you are reading in a new way. You will analyze the sentences and look for sentiment queues which have been inserted to mold your opinion on the given topic at a deeper level than you may otherwise consciously notice.

The second slide show will introduce you to how to use this extension. In short, it requires you to highlight and then hit a hotkey to triage and store interesting sentences that you come across.

This app is not working behind the scenes to process anything that you're seeing... yet. Before I can get that kind of cool functionality I need some humans to do some of the heavy lifting for me.

There are some extremely cool ideas I have to inject some broad analysis into your news pages, but first gotta start with the low tech stuff <3

**Note on foreign languages:** It is all right to annotate in multiple languages. Each sample we're sent is individually automatically translated into English, so it's all good.

**Excitement for _next week's_ update:** <mark style="background-color:yellow">We're getting <mark style="background-color:lightgreen">text-highlighting capabilities</mark> so you'll immediately know what you've notated! It's not perfect, but ill tell you more when Chrome finally accepts the update next week...</mark>

**Testimonials:**

*   _"This is actually super fun to do with legal articles because these are supposed to be neutral and so they mostly are, but when you read them piece by piece like you have to do in order to code them, it really highlights how legal writing can very powerfully shape your understanding of an issue through subtle sentiment markers."_
